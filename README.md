# contamination.and.boostedGS
Code for contamination experiments and boosted versions of Standard Gibbs Sampling 
This code goes with the paper by Garc√≠a-Donato and Castellanos (2024)

How to use:
Use the sentences in the file ExampleALLmethods-vc.R to obtain exact inclusion probabilities with different values of p for a (virtually) contaminated experiment (n=500, kt=4) and their estimation using PARNI, ASI, TGS, wTGS and SGS.

Use the sentences in the file ExampleALLmethods-sc.R to obtain estimation of inclusion probabilities with different values of p for a contaminated -via simulation- experiment (n=500, kt=4) and their estimation using PARNI, ASI, TGS, wTGS and SGS.

Since the virtually contaminated experiment "emulates" the simulated experiment, you should expect see similar results for the inclusion probabilities.

In several places we are using functions coming from the github repositories (accessed in 2023) [1] XitongLiang/The-PARNI-scheme and [2] gZanella/TGS that, accompany the papers Liang, Livingstone, Griffin (2021) and Zanella and Roberts (2018) respectively. In particular ASI.R and PARNI.R are essentially the files with the same names in [1]; other_supportive_functions.R is a light version of the file with the same name in [1]; make_hyper_par.R is a modified version of the file with the same name in [1] but adapted to include our contributions; functions_for_BVS.R is a modified version of the file with the same name in [2] adapted to make it possible computation of TGS and wTGS handling g-Zellner prior in a fast and more reliable way; bf_g_L_4GS.R is an adaptation of the file with the name bf_g_L.R in [1] to be run with the vectorized version of Gibbs Sampling. All the other functions are built from scratch.
